Welcome to Tide, a software for Tiled Interactive DisplayWall Environments
providing multi-user touch interaction for collaborations.

Tide is the direct successor of DisplayCluster at
[BlueBrain](https://github.com/BlueBrain/DisplayCluster.git). Amongst several
performance and stability improvements, Tide provides asynchronous data loading,
texture uploading and tile-based content rendering which is based on a
distributed, event-driven QtQuick2 engine.

Tide provides the following features:
* Interactively view, present and collaborate on media such as high-resolution
  images and movies.
* Receive and interact with content streamed from remote sources such as
  laptops / desktops or high-performance remote visualization machines using the
  [Deflect library](https://github.com/BlueBrain/Deflect.git).
